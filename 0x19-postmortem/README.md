Postmortem Report: The Case of the Sneaky Nginx Bug 🕵️‍♂️
Issue Summary:
Duration of the Outage:
Start time: August 15, 2024, 02:00 AM UTC
End time: August 15, 2024, 05:00 AM UTC
(Total duration: 3 hours)

Impact:
During the outage, 85% of our users were greeted by the infamous "502 Bad Gateway" error. Some were concerned that they had been cast into the digital abyss, while others just switched to cat videos on YouTube. The remaining 15% (the lucky few) experienced slower loading times and managed to keep their sanity.

Root Cause:
Turns out, the Nginx server wasn't happy after its latest security update. A tiny typo in the configuration file caused the server to throw a tantrum and block access to critical services. Lesson learned: Nginx doesn’t appreciate being ignored. 🧨

Timeline:
02:05 AM: Nginx is having a meltdown. Monitoring alerts triggered—phones start buzzing. 🚨
02:10 AM: On-call engineer grabs a coffee and dives in. ☕️
02:15 AM: Initial theory: Blame the database! Spoiler alert: It wasn’t the database. 😅
02:30 AM: Database clears its name. Suspicion shifts to the application layer. 👀
03:00 AM: Nginx config under the microscope—something doesn’t smell right here… 🧐
03:30 AM: Bingo! Misconfigured Nginx settings identified. 🎯
04:00 AM: Fix deployed; Nginx is pacified. The website slowly comes back to life. 🌱
05:00 AM: Everything’s back to normal. Engineers sigh with relief. 😌
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:

The Nginx server decided to take a nap after we unintentionally messed with its configuration file during a security update. A small error in the settings caused Nginx to block all incoming traffic to the backend. Think of it as Nginx pulling up a "Do Not Disturb" sign—except nobody asked for it.

Resolution:
Our quick-thinking engineers reverted the configuration to its previous, well-behaved version. After double-checking everything (and whispering sweet nothings to the server), the changes were applied and Nginx was restarted. Peace was restored, and the website went back to serving users as usual.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements:

Stricter Testing: More testing on config files before any updates go live. Nginx clearly wants some extra attention before it plays nice.
Automated Backups: We’ll implement automatic backups of configuration files, so we can roll back faster than you can say “502 error.”
Enhanced Monitoring: We’ll add more detailed alerts, so we catch these misconfigurations before they cause a scene.
Tasks:

Double-check Nginx configurations before hitting "Deploy."
Write automated tests to catch typos and misconfigurations.
Increase server monitoring with specific alerts for Nginx issues.
Schedule a team training session on the joys and pitfalls of managing Nginx (and maybe a bit of yoga to stay calm during outages).
Engaging Elements:
During the chaos of the outage, we circulated this meme internally. It sums up the experience quite well:


“I don’t always break things, but when I do, it’s right before I go to sleep.”
